<h1>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</h1>

<p>
The following exercises are minimal XSS examples. That is, on
each page, it is possible for you to provide input that will
be executed as JavaScript. <b>Your goal for each page</b>
is to provide input that will cause an alert box to pop up.
</p>

<p>
For <a href="{{url_for('routes.hello_html')}}">hello html</a> and
<a href="{{url_for('routes.hello_js')}}">hello js</a>, you can provide input that
will cause one alert box to pop up. On
<a href="{{url_for('routes.hello_html_attr')}}">hello html attr</a>, it's
possible to cause 2 popup alerts with the right input. 
</p>

<p>
You can cause these popups to trigger without modifying the
server code or by manually editing the DOM of the page. Simply
providing the right input is enough.
</p>

<p>
But how do you provide the input? Check out
<code>routes/xss.py</code>, which defines the routes. I've
added more descriptive comments there.
</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

<h2>XSS Exercises</h2>

<ol>
  <li><a href="{{url_for('routes.hello_html')}}">hello html</a></li>
  <li><a href="{{url_for('routes.hello_html_attr')}}">hello html attr</a></li>
  <li><a href="{{url_for('routes.hello_js')}}">hello js</a> - For this page,
    the goal is to provide an input such that the alert
    popup occurs as the page is loading without needing to
    click on any button.</li>
</ol>

<a href="/">Back</a>

<h2>Troubleshooting Tips</h2>

<h4>Not sure how to provide arguments to the page?</h4>
See <code>routes/xss.py</code> for a description.


<h4>Having trouble getting an alert box to pop up?</h4>
I'd recommend reviewing the following files for the
exercise you're working on:

<ul>
<li>The template generating the page in <code>templates/</code>.</li>
<li>Right click on the page and select "View Page Source" to 
    see what HTML your input is creating.</li>
<li>On the page itself, right-click and select 
    "Inspect element". Click on the "Console" tab. The
     browser will tell you when your input is causing the
     generated HTML or JavaScript to be malformed.</li>
  <ul><li><i>Hint:</i> sometimes your JavaScript won't run
      because of this.</li></ul>
</ul>

<h4>Doing the right thing but your attack still isn't 
working?</h4>

<p>Chrome is generally pretty smart about blocking reflected
XSS attacks (which all of these are). Try using Firefox instead.</p>

<h3>Post-Exercise Stuff to Think About</h3>

After you complete the exercises, think about where
you were able to execute the JavaScript. Why did some insertion
points work and some didn't? What does <code>safe</code> do?
