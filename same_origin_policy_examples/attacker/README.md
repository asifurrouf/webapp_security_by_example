# Attacker.com

Simple web site for an example evil website, to be run in tandem with "kittens.com",
  as implemented by `../kittens`.

## Running

**Note**: Open a new terminal to run this web app, so that the Flask app implemented
by `kittens.py` and `attacker.py` are *both* running at the same time.

     $ python3 attacker.py    # python 3

     # Or

     $ python attacker.py     # python 2.X
