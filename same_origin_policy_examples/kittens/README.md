# Kittens.com

Simple web site for an example benign website, to be run in tandem with "attacker.com",
  as implemented by `../attacker`.

## Running

This server has the same requirements as `hello_flask`, so follow the installation
instructions there and you should be able to run this and the `attacker` web app.

These web apps were written using Python 3, but probably work with Python 2.

     $ python3 kittens.py    # python 3

     # Or

     $ python kittens.py     # python 2.X
