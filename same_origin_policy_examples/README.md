# Same Origin Policy Examples

This directory contains two simple web apps that you'll run simultaneously
(`kittens.com` and `attacker.com`) to see first-hand:

* How, when, and where your browser sends cookies
* What JavaScript is allowed to do (in terms of making requests and reading the responses)
* And more!

The **goal** of these examples is to give you a better understanding of how your browser
and web sites work, to put the various attack examples in `hello_flask` into
context (especially XSS and CSRF).

## Running the Web Apps

See their respective `README` files. 

The kittens webapp (`kittens/README.md`) contains the most info, go there first.
